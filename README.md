# ✨ Advent of Code 2019 ✨

## My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) written in [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/)

I use [esy](https://esy.sh/) to run the puzzles. In `./bin` you will find each puzzle.

### Running puzzles

Puzzles are numbered `{1..25}`

```
esy dune exec bin/day_1/puzzle.exe
```
